# Typescript
TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.

# express
Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.  It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server, meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins. together with the MongoDB database software and a JavaScript front-end framework or library.

# socket.io
Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server, It is built on top of the WebSocket protocol and provides additional guarantees like fallback to HTTP long-polling or automatic reconnection.
